        <h1>Additional Recommendations</h1>
        
        <h2><a id="emergencies">Be Prepared for Emergencies</a></h2>
        <p>Have a plan in case a worker experiences heat-related illness. Everyone on site should know the procedures for responding to possible heat-related illness:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What steps to follow if a worker has <a href="Signs and Symptoms.html">signs or symptoms</a> of heat-related illness.</li>
            <li>Who to call for medical help and how to give clear directions to the worksite if calling 911.</li>
            <li>Who will provide <a href="First Aid.html">first aid</a> until the ambulance arrives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Post signs with the above information at worksites where heat is a hazard in English and other languages of workers.</p>
        <p>A written Heat Alert Program (see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/">NIOSH Pub No. 2016-106, Section 6.2.6</a>) should be developed and implemented whenever the weather service forecasts a heat wave is likely to occur.</p>

        <h2><a id="training">Provide Training</a></h2>
        <p>Train workers before hot outdoor work begins. Tailor training to cover worksite-specific conditions.</p>
        <p>Train all workers and supervisors about the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognition of the <a href="Signs and Symptoms.html">signs and symptoms</a> of heat-related illnesses.</li>
            <li>Causes of heat-related illnesses and prevention.</li>
            <li>Proper care and use of heat-protective clothing and equipment. </li>
            <li>Risk factors for heat-related illness.</li>
            <li>The importance of acclimatization.</li>
            <li>The importance of immediately reporting any symptoms or signs of heat-related illness.</li>
            <li>Procedures for responding to symptoms of heat-related illness and contacting emergency medical services if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, supervisors should be trained on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to implement appropriate acclimatization.</li>
            <li>What procedures to follow when a worker has symptoms consistent with heat-related illness, including emergency procedures.</li>
            <li>How to monitor weather reports. </li>
            <li>How to respond to hot weather advisories.</li>
            <li>How to monitor and encourage adequate fluid intake and rest breaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="acclimatize">Take Time to Acclimatize</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gradually increase time working in hot conditions over 7 to 14 days. </li>
            <li>For new workers, the schedule should be no more than 20% of the usual duration of work in the heat on day 1 and no more than a 20% increase on each additional day.</li>
            <li>For workers with recent experience, the schedule should be no more than 50% of the usual duration of work in the heat on day 1, 60% on day 2, 80% on day 3, and 100% on day 4.</li>
            <li>Closely supervise new employees for the first 14 days or until they are fully acclimatized.</li>
            <li>Non-physically fit workers require more time to fully acclimatize.</li>
            <li>Acclimatization can be maintained for a few days of non-heat exposure.</li>
            <li>Taking breaks in air conditioning will not affect acclimatization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="water">Stay Well Hydrated</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Employers should provide the means for appropriate hydration.</li>
            <li>Water should be clean, less than  15°C (59°F), and made accessible near the work area.</li>
            <li>Estimate how much water will be needed and decide who will obtain and check on water supplies.</li>
            <li>Encourage workers to hydrate themselves. </li>
            <li>If in the heat less than 2 hours and involved in moderate work activities, drink 1 cup (8 oz.) of water every 15–20 minutes.</li>
            <li>During prolonged sweating lasting several hours, drink sports drinks containing balanced electrolytes.</li>
            <li>Individual, not communal, drinking cups should be provided. </li>
            <li>Avoid alcohol and drinks with high caffeine or sugar.</li>
            <li>Generally, fluid intake should not exceed 6 cups per hour.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Watch for Signs and Symptoms of Heat-related Illness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check routinely to make sure workers are making use of water and shade and not experiencing heat-related <a href="Signs and Symptoms.html">signs and symptoms</a>.</li>
            <li>Monitor new workers and unacclimatized workers more closely.</li>
            <li>Implement a buddy system in which workers are responsible for observing fellow workers for early signs of heat-related illness. </li>
            <li>For workers wearing heavy or non-breathable clothing or during extreme heat conditions, check for physical signs (e.g., body temperature, heart rate) of possible over exposure to the heat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="rest">Take Time to Rest and Cool Down</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Permit rest and water breaks when a worker feels heat discomfort.</li>
            <li>Modify work/rest periods to give the body a chance to get rid of excess heat. </li>
            <li>Assign new and unacclimatized workers lighter work and longer, more frequent rest periods. </li>
            <li>Shorten work periods and increase rest periods:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>As temperature, humidity, and sunshine increase.</li>
            <li>When there is no air movement.</li>
            <li>If protective clothing or equipment is worn.</li>
            <li>For heavier work.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
