        <h1>Very High to Extreme Risk</h1>
        <p>Conditions are dangerous! Heat-related illness can develop faster and be more serious at this risk level. Extra measures are recommended.</p>
        <p><strong>Reschedule all non-essential work for days when the heat index is lower. Move essential work to the coolest part of the day â€“ start earlier, split the work shift, or work evening/night shifts.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Strenuous tasks and those requiring the use of heavy or non-breathable clothing or impermeable chemical protective clothing should not be conducted.</strong></p>
        <p>If emergency or essential work must be done at this heat index, then a designated knowledgeable person should be on-site to modify work activities and set work/rest schedules. <strong>STOP WORK if protective measures are not possible.</strong></p>
        <p>For emergency work and essential work that cannot be rescheduled, review the tips below and on OSHA's Heat Illness campaign site: <a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/protective_veryhigh.html">Actions for Very High to Extreme Risk Conditions</a>.</p>

        <h2>Water and Shade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adequate amounts of <a href="More Details.html#water">drinking water</a> must be in convenient, visible locations close to the work area.</li>
            <li>Establish a clear drinking schedule.</li>
            <li>Actively encourage workers to drink water often.</li>
            <li>If in the heat less than 2 hours and involved in moderate work activities, drink 1 cup (8 oz.) of water every 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>During prolonged sweating lasting several hours, drink sports drinks containing balanced electrolytes.</li>
            <li>Generally, fluid intake should not exceed 6 cups per hour.</li>
            <li>Set up cool, shaded rest areas.</li>
            <li>Provide shade, hats, and sunscreen, and encourage their use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emergency Planning and Response</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert workers to the very high to extreme heat index and identify all precautions in place at the work site.</li>
            <li>Have a knowledgeable person on site to determine work/rest schedule and conduct physiological monitoring.</li>
            <li>Check weather forecast regularly and make sure plans are in place before hot outdoor work begins.</li>
            <li>Make sure medical help (clinic, hospital, emergency services) is nearby&mdash;if not, <a href="First Aid.html">first aid</a> must be performed on site. </li>
            <li>Appropriately trained personnel and adequate medical supplies need to be available.</li>
            <li>Know where you are in case you need to call 911.</li>
            <li>Call 911 and cool a worker who is unconscious, confused, or uncoordinated. This may be heat stroke, a medical emergency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Work and Rest</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="More Details.html#acclimatize">Acclimatize</a> new and returning workers. These individuals are at higher risk for heat-related illness. Closely supervise unacclimatized workers.</li>
            <li>Establish and follow a work/rest schedule. Take into account the level of exertion and type of personal equipment used.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Supervisors should enforce rest breaks in cool, shaded areas.</li>
                <li>Remove protective clothing (if possible) while resting.</li>
                <li>Increase rest time as heat index rises or if workers show signs of heat-related illness.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adjust work activities:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do strenuous tasks earlier in the day.</li>
                <li>Where possible, set up shade canopies over work areas.</li>
                <li>Permit only acclimatized workers to perform more strenuous tasks.</li>
                <li>Decrease the pace of strenuous job tasks.</li>
                <li>Look for other ways to adjust work activities (add more workers, rotate jobs).</li>
                <li>Reschedule activities for when the heat index is lower (morning, evening, different day).</li>
                <li>Modify work/rest schedules to accommodate those wearing protective clothing.</li>
                <li>Physiologically monitor workers (e.g., body temperature, heart rate).</li>
                <li>Rotate workers to tasks that do not require protective clothing for part of the shift.</li>
                <li>Encourage removal of protective clothing when on rest breaks, when possible.</li>
                <li>Provide personal cooling measures (e.g., water-dampened clothing, cooling vests, misting stations).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Training:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Review heat-related illness <a href="Signs and Symptoms.html">signs and symptoms</a> and site-specific precautions during daily meetings or toolbox talks.</li>
            <li>Make sure everyone is <a href="More Details.html#training">trained</a> on: </li>

        <h2>Watching Out for Heat-related Illness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check heart rate, temperature, or other physical signs of heat exposure at rest breaks.</li>
            <li>Set up a buddy system to enable workers to look out for signs and symptoms of heat-related illness in each other.</li>
            <li>Supervisors should maintain communications at all times with workers, watching for signs or symptoms of heat-related illness, and encourage water and rest breaks.</li>
